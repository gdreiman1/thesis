# May_18 Summary

## Things I did (as of 29 May)

1. Created a pipeline to extract and save 1024 hashed Morgan fingerprints and 97 molecular characteristics. 
2. Script to run model zoo against the processed data
3. Optimized neural network wrt focal loss, it was over fitting and it still may be valuable to follow the procedure for fixing the bias to approximate probability in early epochs

## Going Forwards (next two days)

1. Get 7 more data sets processed
   1. Got 3
2. Get lightGBM working
   1. Working
3. Download and train graph CNN for latents
4. Consider use of [Estimated Kernel SVM][]
5. Do a comprehensive write up
6. Start Saving Models
